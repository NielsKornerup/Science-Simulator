# Science-Simulator
In high school, I made a number of different science simulators. I decided to create this project using the framework of my other projects so that other people could make their own science simulators. To use this template, you can add various user inputed settings to index.html. To add functionality, you will want to modify code.js. Let me know if you have any questions!
